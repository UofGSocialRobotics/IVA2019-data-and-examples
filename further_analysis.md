-- explore bi-modal distributions; Matthew Stone metaphoric gestures
elaborate on wordnet rules
% \section{Computational Implications}
% Because this schema is formulated with the goal of generating gestures for virtual humans, we use a hierarchical model of metaphor instances, gesture, and linguistic referents to create rules which can then be used to match against new utterances to create novel gestures. By abstracting over syntactic and semantic elements of speech, we can create generalizable patterns which may be used to generate gestures from surface text in virtual agents. 
% Describe how these patterns are created (syntax parser $\rightarrow{}$ wordnet $\rightarrow{}$ pattern) 

% (Avail Audience) This referent can then be abstracted using WordNet to ``group of people,'' or more generally ``group,'' which can then be used to create a generic rule for this syntactic structure. 

% Because we use WordNet to traverse and generalize over object properties, however, these may both resolve to properties such as ``tension,'' or ``stress.'' 

% One criticism we foresee of this schema is its lack of rigorous reproducibility. However, we measure inter-annotator agreement not by the precise object and movement annotations that are made, but by the generalizable rules that are formulated from each annotation. Through this method, free-response commentary actually takes advantage of the subjective nature of metaphoric gestures to generate patterns which can be matched based on predicted likelihoods. 
% Annotators must be highly trained. Inter-annotator agreement at this stage is largely focused on metaphors, although not exclusively so.
